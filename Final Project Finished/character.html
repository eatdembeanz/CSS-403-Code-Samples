          <h2>About this page</h2>
          <p class="lead">This page will provide some handy tips for keeping track of YOUR characters. Below is a list of generally good ideas. The most important part of making characters is ensuring that readers can follow who they are, what they want, and what they're doing.</p>
            <h5>When designing characters, you should...</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Keep everyone's names easily differentiated, but don't make them <i>too</i> exotic-- a crazy word salad name is as difficult to remember as a single-letter name!</li>
            <li>Try to think out a personality and moral system for your character while you're writing them, so that you can more easily recognize when they're acting in a way that runs counter to what they were doing earlier.</li>
            <li>Put characters with complimentary personalities and goals together! It's easier to write a scene out if the characters involved can find easy common ground with eachother!</li>
            <li>If you're unsure of how you want a character to pan out, don't be afraid to crib notes from other works!</li>

<h1>Examples</h1>
                  <button onclick="myFunction('Demo1')" class="w3-btn w3-block w3-black w3-left-align">BAD Example</button>
<div id="Demo1" class="w3-container w3-hide">
                <p>Khazgar the Child-Stomper looked down at the wife and children of his rival Khadgar. It would be easy for him to leap down and kill them all... but Khazgar was not an evil man. Bazgar, his dear friend, came to Khazgar's side. "You really are a dumbass, Khazgar." he said.</p>
</div>
            <button onclick="myFunction('Demo2')" class="w3-btn w3-block w3-black w3-left-align">GOOD Example</button>
<div id="Demo2" class="w3-container w3-hide">
<p>Bob looked down on his sworn enemy Khazgar the Child-Stomper. It would be poetic justice to stomp Khazgar's children, but Bob was not an evil man. It would be wrong to stomp <i>anyone's</i> child. Albert patted Bob on the back and gave him a sympathetic smile. "Do what you have to do, Bob."</p></div>
